In Think and Grow Rich, Hill draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and other millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles. This book will teach you the secrets that could bring you a fortune. It will show you not only what to do but how to do it. Once you learn and apply the simple, basic techniques revealed here, you will have mastered the secret of true and lasting success. Money and material things are essential for freedom of body and mind, but there are some who will feel that the greatest of all riches can be evaluated only in terms of lasting friendships, loving family relationships, understanding between business associates, and introspective harmony which brings one true peace of mind! All who read, understand, and apply this philosophy will be better prepared to attract and enjoy these spiritual values.\nlink: https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LMk6EAAAQBAJ\npreviewLink: http://books.google.com.br/books?id=LMk6EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=quem+pensa+enriquece&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api\nisbn13: 9783985943753\nisbn10: 3985943753\n---\n",
